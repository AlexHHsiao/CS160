    <p>
      We are Alex Xiao, Yizhou Yan, Morgan Chang, Tien Tran, Matthew Sternquist in the same group,
      and have a passion for computer and technology. We are interesting to work with each other
      to apply what we learned to this project such as Apache, SQL, Linux, PHP, C++, Python. Each of
      us knows different kind of languages such as Java, C, C++, Python, PHP, so it is a great idea to
      form a group to do this project. The aims of this project are to detect faces by using OpenCV, OpenFace,
      eye tracking, FFMPEG, Frontend, Backend, Pipeline, and Databases.

        I am a senior student at SJSU, and my passion is technology and
        programming. After graduating electrical engineer and working almost 8 years,
        I recognized that programming is very interesting, necessary. It can apply to solve
        many problems in the real life and many industries. Therefore, I decided to come back the University to study it.
